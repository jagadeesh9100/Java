# SpringBoot-Mailing-Gmail
Spring Boot Mailing Service(GMAIL) Beginner

If you are trying to learn how to send simple mail via gmail using spring boot and u have completely no idea how to go about, you have landed to 
the correct place, this code is tried and tested.
Easy to implemented , documented at places where i thought would be usefull to guide you through
 You just need to add the email FROM and TO and the password in Application.properties files 
 And also since google mantains a security check You got to allow access to less vulnerable sources (go to gmail settings) REMEBER TO turn it
 OFF once u are done learning
 
 Have a great time
